abstractNote = {The recession in the oil industry, and in particular the exploration fields, has not deterred the industry from continued research into the improvement of its geophysical techniques. Latterly, there has been much emphasis on the interpretation of data, and on optimizing data processing systems. The new book series Advances in Exploration Geophysics will reflect the trends in both these areas as well as the new and important aspects of established subjects such as data acquisition.},
