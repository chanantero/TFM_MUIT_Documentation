@article{Lapini2018,
abstract = {Active Noise Control (ANC) methods have been successfully applied to the cancellation of stationary noise. Classical ANC systems use adaptive filtering techniques to produce a waveform that is opposite, or counter-phase, to the signal noise we would like to cancel. However, when the noise is of short duration, adaptive filtering cannot be used since convergence is not achieved. In this paper, a novel active control technique for non-stationary noise is presented. The method uses wave field synthesis (WFS) for the construction of the canceling waveform. The system is tailored for an outdoor environment. The noise acoustic field is acquired by microphones and processed by a WFS engine to pilot a linear array of secondary sources. Experimental results, obtained from both simulations and true tests, demonstrate that the proposed method is able to diminish the overall noise perceived in the area covered by the system.},

abstract = {Practical implementations of sound field synthesis evoke considerable artifacts that have to be considered in the creation of artificial reverberation. The most prominent artifact is spatial aliasing, which manifests itself as additional wave fronts that follow the desired synthetic wave front in time. These additional wave fronts propagate into different directions and occur at intervals that are similar to the intervals at which acoustic reflections occur in real rooms. It may be assumed that the human auditory system is not capable of differentiating aliasing artifacts and room reflections so that a synthetic reflection pattern should be designed such that it evokes a plausible pattern together with the aliased wave fronts. Two potential solutions are outlined. Finally, the capability of sound field synthesis of synthesizing room resonances (room modes) is analyzed and the promising results are illustrated based on numerical simulations.},

abstract = {Wave field synthesis is a powerful method of spatial audio rendering that makes use of the Huygens principle to reproduce physically-accurate wavefronts for virtual sources. Large loudspeaker arrays can be used to synthesize the wavefront of a virtual source that exists outside of the listening room. The technique has traditionally been limited to the horizontal plane due to the prohibitive cost of planar loudspeaker arrays. Multiple line array wave field synthesis is proposed as an extension to linear WFS. This method extends the virtual source space into the vertical dimension using a fraction of the number of loudspeakers required for plane arrays. This thesis details the creation of a cross- platform software environment for wave field synthesis capable of driving a loudspeaker array according to the proposed extension, as well as the construction of a modular, low- cost loudspeaker array that can be adapted to linear, planar, or multiple line configurations.},
